# Deployment

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Set up a VPC

See [Setup AWS VPC with public and private subnets](https://github.com/dwilkie/twilreapi/blob/master/docs/AWS_VPC_SETUP.md)

### Create a new web application environment

Launch a new web application environment using the ruby (Puma) platform. When prompted for the VPC, enter the VPC you created above. When prompted for EC2 subnets, enter the PUBLIC subnets (separated by a comma) for both availability zones. Enter the same for your ELB subnets.

```
$ eb platform select --profile <profile-name>
$ eb create --vpc --profile <profile-name>
```

Set the following ENV Variables:

```
$ eb setenv SECRET_KEY_BASE=`bundle exec rails secret`
```

#### Connecting to RDS

Follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/AWSHowTo.RDS.html?icmpid=docs_elasticbeanstalk_console)

This needs to be done on both the web and worker environments.

#### Background Processing

In order to queue jobs to SQS, support for [active_elastic_job](https://github.com/tawan/active-elastic-job) is built in. Follow the [README](https://github.com/tawan/active-elastic-job).

To use [Active Elastic Job](https://github.com/tawan/active-elastic-job) set the following ENV Variables in your web environment: `ACTIVE_JOB_USE_ACTIVE_JOB=1 ACTIVE_JOB_QUEUE_ADAPTER=active_elastic_job AWS_REGION=<your-aws-region>`

##### Processing Outbound Calls

Set the SQS queue name in the ENV variable `ACTIVE_JOB_ACTIVE_ELASTIC_JOB_OUTBOUND_CALL_WORKER_QUEUE` in your web environment. The queue name will be generated when you create the worker environment.

##### Processing CDRs

Set the SQS queue name in the ENV variable `ACTIVE_JOB_ACTIVE_ELASTIC_JOB_OUTBOUND_CALL_WORKER_QUEUE` in your web environment. The queue name will be generated when you create the worker environment.

### Create a new worker environment

Launch a new worker environment using the ruby (Puma) platform. When prompted for the VPC, enter the VPC you created above. When prompted for EC2 subnets, enter the PRIVATE subnets (separated by a comma for both availability zones). Enter the same for your ELB subnets (note there is no ELB for Worker environments so this setting will be ignored)

```
$ eb create --vpc --tier worker -i t2.nano --profile <profile-name>
```

#### Configure the SQS queue

If you use the autogenerated queue for your worker environment then a dead-letter queue is automatically configured. This setting can be configured in the Elastic Beanstalk web console.

#### Setup Autoscaling based on SQS queue size

I followed [this article](http://blog.cbeer.info/2016/autoscaling-elasticbeanstalk-workers-sqs-length/) but not the section on CloudFormation. The important steps are:

1. Create two CloudWatch alarms for each SQS queue using the AWS CloudWatch console using the metric `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible`. One alarm should be for scaling up, and the other for scaling down.
2. Attach the alarm to the AutoScaling group which was created by Elastic Beanstalk for the worker environment.

### Deploy both the web and worker environments

```
$ eb deploy <webapp-env-name> && eb deploy <worker-env-name>
```

### Running rake tasks

```
$ cd /var/app/current
$ sudo su
$ bundle exec rake <task>
```

### SSH to the worker environment

Since the worker environment is on a private subnet, you can't reach it from the Internet. Instead ssh into your web environment and use ssh forwarding get to your worker instance.

```
$ eb ssh -e "ssh -A"
$ [ec2-user@private_ip_of_web_env ~]$ ssh <private_ip_of_worker_env>
```
